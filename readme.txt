Sidebar Widget To Display Eye Candy Icon to Display Your Social Network Profile 

== Description ==

This plugin is a sidebar widget which will display icons 
for your social network sites that linkback to your 
social networking profiles.

There is a choice of two sizes for the icons 16x16 or 32x32.
Icons have been custom designed therefore unique. 
The display options are Horizontal, Vertical or DropDown.
Horizontal displays the name of the social network, DropDown
displays on hovering over the 'SocialProfilr' custom icon.

The style of display is unique whereby initially 'grey' display
and hover over will display in colour.  

All icons have rel=nofollow, this ensures that your webpage is 
not leaking essential PR juice.

Statistics are provided via the 'socialprofilr statistics' link
under 'tools'within the admin dashboard.  This will show display
which social network profile has been linked on per day. 

***Version With Statistics Only Available If Downloaded From Website***

Insert custom description above social icons.

Since you can only receive this plugin from the SVN repository you will not 
receive the version that has statistics.  By registering and optin at the 
site then you can download the statistic version and should recieve latest 
updates and new creations by email.  Perchance you got this by other medium

developments coming up!
